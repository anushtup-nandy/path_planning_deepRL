# path_planning_deepRL

This project is about making a path planning robot that'll discover the road on it's own, and then follow it.

As of now I've implemented the DQN algorithm, and ran it on the cart-pole env. 

## Help taken:
I took a lot of help from the book "Grokking deep RL" by Miguel Morales to be able to implement the DQN, and for learning!

## Plan:

1. simulate a car training itself to follow a road. (will use KIVY for this)
2. implement DDQN and compare results with DQN.

## Coming soon:
1. I have coded a simpler DQN. I'll put it up as soon as I'm done commenting and organising the files !
